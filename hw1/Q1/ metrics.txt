Average node degree : 2.023
The Average degree of a node is the number of relation (edge) it has, independently if it\'92s a in or a out relation. It\'92s the average of edges for one node.)

Diameter of the graph : 4
The maximal distance between all pairs of nodes :4)

Average path length :3.65
The average graph-distance between all pairs of nodes which measures derive from the distance: Betweenness Centrality )
