1. Implementation 

1) Use just one tree. One by one justify features , split on average of the feature and compute the entropy difference to valid the efficiency until there is no more gain or features. 
2) By using random.randint to generate random dataset and then use OOB to calculate the relative error.


2. accuracy of OOB is 0.8355
